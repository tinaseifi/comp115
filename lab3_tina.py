Understanding the following three examples is beneficial for you to move to the exercise 1 below.
"""

# Example 1 - Draw 10 steps with each step 20 pixels by 20 pixels.
# num_steps = 10
# alex = turtle.Turtle()
# alex.speed(5)  # 1 sets the drawing speed as the slowest.
# for _ in range(num_steps): # _ means this loop variable is unused, just repeat loop body num_steps times
#     alex.forward(20) # 20 pixels
#     alex.left(90) # Angle
#     alex.forward(20)
#     alex.right(90)
# alex.shape("blank")  # After drawing, make the alex/pen/brush invisible.


# Example 2 - Draw an equilateral triangle with side length 100 pixels
# Uncomment the line 33 to 41

# alex.clear()  # Clear the previous drawing on the screen.
# alex.speed(1)
# alex.shape("turtle")
# side_length = 100
# exterior_angle = 360 / 3  # Calculate the exterior angle of an equilateral triangle.
# for _ in range(3):
#     alex.forward(side_length)
#     alex.left(exterior_angle)
# alex.shape("blank")


# Example 3 - Draw a sqaure with side length 200 pixels
# Uncomment the line 47 to 57

# alex.clear()  # Clear the previous drawing on the screen.
# alex.shape("arrow")
# alex.up() # alex.up() lifts alex/pen/brush up;
# alex.goto(0, 0) # Go to the center of the drawing screen
# alex.down() # alex.down() puts alex/pen/brush down, ready for drawing.
# side_length = 100
# exterior_angle = 360 / 4  # Calculate the exterior angle of an equilateral triangle.
# for _ in range(4):
#     alex.forward(side_length)
#     alex.left(exterior_angle)
# alex.shape("blank")


'''
Exercise 1 - To draw a regular hexagon:

You may have noticed that to draw a square is very similar 
to draw an equilateral triangle. We need to calculate 
the exterior angle of a square, which is the angle your turtle/pen/brush
will turn.

Now, similar as example 2 and 3, 
but draw a regular hexagon (6 sides) with side length 100.

Hint:
num_sides = 6
exterior_angle = 360 / num_sides
'''

# Code your exe 1 here
# num_sides = 6
# side_length = 100
# exterior_angle = 360 / num_sides

# alice = turtle.Turtle()
# alice.speed(5)

# for _ in range(num_sides) :
#     alice.forward(side_length)
#     alice.left(exterior_angle)

# alice.hideturtle()

Part 2

Understanding the following examples 4 and 5 is beneficial for you to move to the exercise 2 below.
"""

'''
Example 4 - Review lab2 last exercise
Uncomment the code below in this example, run the file and see the output 
This example clearly demonstrates accessing list elements by index.
'''
# day_today = 3
# days_trip = 5
# day_back = (day_today + days_trip)%7

# days_week = [
#     "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
#     "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"
# ]

# print(f'''
# Your trip starts on day {day_today} ({days_week[day_today]}),
# lasts days {days_trip}. 
# You are back on day {day_back} ({days_week[day_back]}).
# ''')

'''
Example 5 - Draw a number of concentric circles
Uncomment the code below in this example, run the file and see the output 
This example clearly demonstrates accessing list elements by loop variables.
'''

# num_circles = 7
# rainbow_colors = ["violet", "indigo", "blue",
#                    "green", "yellow", "orange", "red"]
# radius = 30
# radius_increase = 10
# alex.clear()  # Clear the previous drawing on the screen.
# alex.speed(5)
# alex.pensize(5)
# alex.up()
# for rainbow_color in rainbow_colors:
#     alex.color(rainbow_color)
#     alex.goto(0, -radius)
#     alex.down()
#     alex.circle(radius)
#     radius = radius + radius_increase
#     alex.up()
# alex.shape("blank")



'''
Exercise 2 - To draw a rainbow (like this one https://elearn.capu.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=3237843):
You can set your own initial radius and increment value.

Hint: You may need to use the functions below:
alex.circle(-radius, 180)
alex.backward()
'''

# Code your exe 2 here
radius = 60
increase = 12

colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

alex = turtle.Turtle()
alex.speed(0)
alex.pensize(12)

for c in colors :
    alex.penup()
    alex.goto(-radius, 0)
    alex.setheading(90)
    alex.pendown()

    alex.pencolor(c)
    alex.circle(-radius, 180)

    radius = radius + increase

alex.hideturtle()










drawing_screen.mainloop() # Wait for the user to close the drawing screen
