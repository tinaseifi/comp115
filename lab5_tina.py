Lab 5 - Functions and Lists 
(100 marks in total, including 7 exercises)

Author:  tina
Due Date: This Friday (Feb. 6) 5pm.

Objective:
1. Practice coding simple Python functions and writing unit tests testing functions by assert
2. Practice how to operate on lists
3. Practice with iterations using loop
4. Practice using the accumulator algorithm pattern (Initialize-Loop-Return):
   Initialize a variable that is assigned to an integer, a list, etc. 
   Loop (for or while) to update the variable based on requirements; 
   Return the variable or a value related to this variable.

Example 1: 

To implement a function for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle,
we know this function should have two parameters as inputs: length and width
of a rectangle.
We should also know this function should return a value of the perimeter.
Before or after our function implementation, we know that our function, let's say,
function's name is rectangle_perimeter, shoud pass the unit tests such as:
assert rectangle_perimeter(5, 6) == 22
assert rectangle_perimeter(1.25, 2.43) == 7.36
assert rectangle_perimeter(1.001, 2.005) == 6.01
"""

def rectangle_perimeter(length, width):
    perimeter = (length + width) * 2
    return round(perimeter, 2) # Round to the result to two decimal places


assert rectangle_perimeter(5, 6) == 22
assert rectangle_perimeter(1.25, 2.43) == 7.36
assert rectangle_perimeter(1.001, 2.005) == 6.01

"""
Exercise 1 (10 marks)

1 US dollar is around 1.34 Canadian dollars.
Write a function that takes American dollars as input 
and return the Canadian dollars equivalent. 

Requirement: Use round() to round the result to two decimal places.
For example, convert_american_dollars(100.05) should return 134.07

Uncomment the unit tests below to verify your function implementation.
"""


def convert_american_dollars(american_dollars):
    canadian = american_dollars * 1.34
    return round(canadian, 2)

assert convert_american_dollars(1) == 1.34
assert convert_american_dollars(100) == 134
assert convert_american_dollars(100.05) == 134.07


"""
Exercise 2 (10 marks)

Here is one of the exercises in lab 2:

# day_today = 3
# days_trip = 5
# day_back = (day_today + days_trip)%7

# days_week = [
#     "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
#     "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"
# ]

Convert the above code into a function named back_day_from_trip
with day_today and days_trip as input parameters, and return the name of the week day. 
Your function should be able to pass the unit tests below. 

Uncomment the unit tests below to verify your function implementation.
"""

days_week = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

def back_day_from_trip(day_today, days_trip):
    day_back = (day_today + days_trip) % 7
    return days_week[day_back]

assert back_day_from_trip(3, 5) == "Tuesday"
assert back_day_from_trip(1, 2) == "Thursday"
assert back_day_from_trip(1, 7) == "Tuesday"

#print(back_day_from_trip(3, 5))



"""
Example 2 - To implement our own sum function that takes a list of numbers
as a parameter and returns the sum of the numbers.
"""
def my_sum(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    return total

assert my_sum([1, 4, 5]) == 10
assert my_sum([9, 5]) == 14


"""
Exercise 3 (10 marks) - From interactive textbook 10.31.4

Write a function called average that takes a list of numbers as a parameter 
and returns the average of the numbers.

(Note: there is a built-in function named sum() but pretend you cannot use it.)

Uncomment the unit tests below to verify your function implementation.

"""

# Function implementation (10 marks)
def average(nums):
    total = 0

"""
Exercise 4 (10 marks) - From interactive textbook 10.31.6

Write a function sum_of_squares(xs) that 
computes the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list nums. 
For example, sum_of_squares([2, 3, 4]) should return 4 + 9 + 16 which is 29:

Hint: you can use the power operator ** to calculate square

Exercise 5 (20 marks)

Write a Python function named add_number that adds a constant k to every element,
and return the list.

"""
Exercise 6 (20 marks) 

Write a function called squares() that takes a list of numbers nums as its parameter 
and returns a list of nums' squares.

For example,
squres([1, 2, 3, 4]) will return [1, 4, 9, 16]
squares([2, 4, 6, 7, 8]) will return [4, 16, 36, 49, 64]

Hint:
Create a variable assigned to an empty list [], 
and use the append() to add the required elements to the list.

Exercise 7 (20 marks) 

Write a function called repeat_elements() that takes a list of numbers nums as its parameter
