Objective (By the end of this lab, you will be able to):
1. understand what a comment is in Python
2. use the python3 interpreter to run your .py file
3. recognize common errors in coding: syntax error, semantic (logic) error, and runtime error
4. debug simple Python programs by fixing common errors

#-------What is a comment in programming languages?---------------------------------
# A regular comment in Python usually starts with a #. 
# Regular comments are used to explain parts of the code for developers reading it.
# Comments are not run as code by the interpreter.
# So this part is a comment. # is only able to comment one line at a time. 
# If you want to comment multiple lines, 
# you can use command + / (Mac) or ctl + / (Windows). 
# Or you can use ''' ''' or """ """ to create a multiline string or a docstring. 
#---------------------------------------------------------


#---------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 1 (20 marks) - Run the file. 
# You should see the output "Hello, World!" in the terminal.
# Then modify the code below so that it prints "Hello, Alice!" instead.
#---------------------------------------------------------

print("Hello, Alice!")

#---------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2 (20 marks)- syntax error 
# Firstly, uncomment the line 42.
# Then fix its syntax error, to make it print the result of 5 + 6.
#---------------------------------------------------------

print(5 + 6)

#---------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3 (20 marks) - Semantic error
# Firstly, uncomment the line 52.
# Then fix its semantic error, to make it calculate the area of the rectangle correctly.
#---------------------------------------------------------


print("The area of a rectangle with length 3 and width 4 is", 3 * 4)

#---------------------------------------------------------
# Pre-exercise: Set up your GitHub, following https://elearn.capu.ca/pluginfile.php/3932839/mod_resource/content/1/GitHub%20Setup.pdf
# Exercise 4 (30 marks) - Write a letter to your instructor
# Firstly, uncomment the lines from 61 to 80.
# Then change the variable values from line 61 to 65 to your info.

Hi,

I am Tina I like playing Piano
My experience level in coding is (no experience), at least I think.
I would love to learning coding {5} hours per week.
Here is my COMP115 repo at GitHub: {my_github_comp115_repo}.

Hope we will have fun in learning Python together this term! 

Cheers,
